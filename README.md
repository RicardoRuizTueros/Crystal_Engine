## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Crystal Engine is currently untested on other development environments by the time, but we're working to bring it to Mac/Linux as well.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/RicardoRuizTueros/Crystal_Engine`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
